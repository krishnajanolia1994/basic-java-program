Using Hue, Saturation, and Brightness
The hue-saturation-brightness (HSB) color model is an alternative to red-green-blue (RGB) for
specifying particular colors. Figuratively, hue is a wheel of color. The hue is specified with a
number between 0.0 and 1.0 (the colors are approximately red, orange, yellow, green, blue,
indigo, and violet). Saturation is another scale ranging from 0.0 to 1.0, representing light pastels
to intense hues. Brightness values also range from 0.0 to 1.0, where 1 is bright white and 0
is black. Color supplies two methods that let you convert between RGB and HSB. They are
shown here:

static int HSBtoRGB(float hue, float saturation, float brightness)
static float[ ] RGBtoHSB(int red, int green, int blue, float values[ ])
