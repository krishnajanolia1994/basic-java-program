Thus, main( ) cannot directly
instantiate a SwingDemo object. Instead, it must create a Runnable object that executes on
the event dispatching thread and have this object create the GUI.

Two methods that are defined by the SwingUtilities class. These methods are invokeLater( )
and invokeAndWait( ). They are shown here:
static void invokeLater(Runnable obj)
static void invokeAndWait(Runnable obj)
throws InterruptedException, InvocationTargetException

Here, obj is a Runnable object that will have its run( ) method called by the event dispatching
thread.The difference between the two methods is that invokeLater( ) returns immediately,
but invokeAndWait( ) waits until obj.run( ) returns.
