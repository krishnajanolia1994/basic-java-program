The content pane can be obtained by calling getContentPane( ) on a JFrame instance.
The getContentPane( ) method is shown here:
Container getContentPane( )
It returns a Container reference to the content pane. The add( ) method was then called on
that reference to add a component to a content pane. Thus, in the past, you had to use the
following statement to add jlab to jfrm:
jfrm.getContentPane().add(jlab); // old-style
Here, getContentPane( ) first obtains a reference to content pane, and then add( ) adds the
component to the container linked to this pane.
